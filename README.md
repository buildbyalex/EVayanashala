****PROJECT DETAILS*******
 This project was intended to digitalize the functions of a library . 
 The users can view and request for renting books of choice. For convenience only 1 copy of a book is added to the app ( as this is a demo app).
 The admin (librarian) can add books, view and control access of users to the app, update the availability status of the books in realtime. 
 We used firebase as our Database, which helped us to update data in real-time. 
 The admin credentials were hard-coded in the code then later moved to the db by using the logic of flags . So if the logged in user is admin the flag value will change to True and opens the app for the admin that is 
different from the user view. The login credentials were shared between all the pages using Shared Preferences.
Similar logic was used to check the avialability status of the books and to control the access of the users .
